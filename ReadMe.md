I did not understand how to use StringBuilder at first, so I attempted it without using it much, 
however I used tutorialspoint.com for examples on how to use StringBuilder and several of it's methods,
along with some of the Character class methods. 
In the end it's not a very pretty code, I wanted to put methods in to track the inputs and changes but ran
out of time to do so neatly. 
I've commented the whole program thoroughly so that it is hopefully easy to read.
I've also left a tester comment that needs to be uncommented if whoever is grading wants to see what movie they are
guessing.
